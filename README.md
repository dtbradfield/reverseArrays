# reverseArrays
Practice reversing arrays with JS, following practice examples in EloquentJS. The only elements I am using that are not created by myself are the sample arrays. I will NOT be using the reverse method, but will construct something similar from scratch in two different ways. The first function will take in an array and output a new array, the reverse of the input. The second function will reverse the array in-line.
